# Korpus Malti v4.2 Dataset Subset for Debiasing Maltese LMs

This dataset is a selected subset of the [Korpus Malti v4.2](https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/) that we specifically curated to analyze and mitigate gender bias in Maltese Language Models (LMs), including BERTu and mBERTu.

## Purpose

Our main goal was to provide **unseen data** for evaluating debiasing techniques. This subset was kept separate from the training data of BERTu and mBERTu to ensure our assessments are unbiased.

## Data Volume

This subset includes **454,515 sentences** from Korpus Malti v4.2 and was vital for **Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA)** and **Dropout Regularization**.
